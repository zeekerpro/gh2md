# GitHub Repository Markdown Integration for Large Language Model Analysis

## Overview

This project streamlines the integration of GitHub repositories into a single Markdown file, making it easier to feed the content into large language models like Kimi for enhanced learning and analysis of source code. This tool is ideal for developers and researchers who seek to leverage AI to understand and document complex codebases efficiently.

## Features

- **Repository Cloning**: Clone repositories using a simple command with the URL of the repository.
- **File Traversal**: Traverse the file structure of the cloned repository and process files based on predefined or user-specified patterns.
- **Markdown Generation**: Convert code and comments within the repository into a Markdown format for easier viewing and analysis.
- **Configurable File Handling**: Use a YAML configuration file to specify patterns of files to skip during the traversal process, making the tool adaptable to different project needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Go 1.15 or higher
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   go build -o code-analysis ./cmd
   ```

### Configuration

Edit the `config/config.yml` file to specify patterns of files you wish to skip during analysis:
```yaml
skip_patterns:
  - "*.tmp"
  - "*.log"
  - ".git"
```

### Usage

To analyze a repository, run the following command:
```bash
./code-analysis <repository-url>
```

This will clone the repository, traverse its structure based on your configuration, and output a Markdown file in the `outputs` directory.
